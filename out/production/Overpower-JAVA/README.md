## Introduction

This repository serves as a sandbox for exploring various Java concepts, including object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and more. Each directory contains a different project or exercise with its own set of files and instructions.

## How to Compile and Run Java Code

To compile and run Java code, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure JDK is Installed**: Download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) from [Oracle's official site](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

2. **Check Installation**: Verify your installation by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    java -version
    ```

3. **Compile Java Code**: Navigate to the directory containing your `.java` files and run:
    ```bash
    javac YourFileName.java
    ```
   This command compiles your Java file and generates a `YourFileName.class` file.

4. **Run Java Code**: Execute the compiled class file using:
    ```bash
    java YourFileName
    ```

### Example:
```bash
cd Project1
javac Main.java
java Main
